	<h1>Introduction </h1>
	<p>Instrumentation engineering is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in areas such as electrical and pneumatic domains, and the control of quantities being measured.
	<br>The required tasks are very domain dependent; instrumentation engineers typically work for industries with automated process with the goal of improving the productivity, reliability, safety, optimisation and stability. Instrumentation engineers are commonly responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for calibration, testing and maintenance of the system. </p>
